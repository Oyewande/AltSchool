        <h2>Why I joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>
          I joined AltSchool to streamline my knowledge of frontend web development.
          I have been self learning for a while, </br>and I feel like there are some gaps
          in between that needs to gaped. I hope to bridge those gaps while i'm
          here.
