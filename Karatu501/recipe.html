      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and
          set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the
          chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the minced garlic and ginger paste, cooking for another minute
          until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the blended tomatoes, peppers and tomato paste, cooking for
          about 5-7 minutes until the mixture thickens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring well to coat the rice with
          the tomato mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, thyme, curry powder, salt, and
          pepper. If using, add scotch bonnet peppers for heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about
          30-35 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the
          liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan and fry the sliced plantain until golden
          brown. Drain excess oil on paper towels
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluff the rice with a fork and let it sit covered for an additional 5
          minutes before serving.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot with fried plantain and your choice of sides.</li>
